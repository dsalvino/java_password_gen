# Simple Java Password Generator
This was a simple password generator created from javascript for bootcampspot as homework. the initial repository had the HTML file that already gave us the skeleton, and the CSS file that styled the HTML for us. the repository also included a javascript file that only included two lines of code to get us started. 
This was also our first yeehaw into our javascript unit.
